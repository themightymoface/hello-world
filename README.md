# hello-world
Making my first GitHub Repository ever. 

I'm Mo, and I'm a complete noob to programming. 
I'm a graduate student in counseling and a small youtuber.  
I like comics, visual novels, games, cartoons and anime, and all things nerdy. 
While I like counseling, it's always been my goal to do something creative in my career and to 
create things like games, videos, and more for people to enjoy. 
I hope I can learn a lot from GitHub and other resources to begin programming 
and understanding problem solving in a computational manner.
